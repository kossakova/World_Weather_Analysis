# World Weather Analysis

## In this project we performed following:

- Generated a set of 2,000 random latitudes and longitudes, retrieved the nearest city, and performed an API call with the OpenWeatherMap. In addition to the city weather data we  gathered in Vacation_Py, we used API to retrieve the current weather description for each city.

- We had the beta testers use input statements to filter the data for their weather preferences, which used to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. 
From the list of potential travel destinations, the beta tester chosen four cities to create a travel itinerary. 

- Finally, using the Google Maps Directions API, we created a travel route between the four cities as well as a marker layer map.
